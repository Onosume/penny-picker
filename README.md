# penny-picker

## What Is This?

Penny Picker is a Win32 command line interface game built using Visual C++. It was originally made for a university assignment, therefore it may have a few issues with how it is implemented, coding style and other such things.

## How Do I Build This?

### Visual Studio 2013

The solution file is one of VS2013. If you have that version you can simply open the solution file and build it to debug or release as you fancy.

### Other Version of Visual Studio

You'll need to create a new project and import the cpp file. This should work with versions of VS from 2003+.

## Are You Doing Anything With This?

Not really, I'm just putting all of my old source code on GitHub for interested people/potential employers and so on. This could do with a lot of refactoring which would be nice at some point but it's not a priority.
